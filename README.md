# AI Projects

Skunkworks for all my AI projects until they are ready for a dedicated repo.

## Tic Tac Toe
This is an implementation of tic tac toe with human vs computer. The computer uses either mimimax or minimax alpha beta pruning AI algorithms. 
You will never beat the AI, only lose and at best tie.
